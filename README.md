This repository demonstrates some uncommon CSS errors and their solutions.  The `bug.css` file contains examples of CSS code with errors. The `bugSolution.css` file provides the corrected code. The errors focus on unitless values in properties requiring units, overly broad selectors, and specificity issues.  This will help developers identify and fix similar issues in their own projects.
