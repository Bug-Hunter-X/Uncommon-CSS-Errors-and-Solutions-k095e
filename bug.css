The CSS code uses a unitless value for a property that requires a unit (e.g., `width: 10;` instead of `width: 10px;`). This can lead to unexpected behavior or rendering issues, as the browser might default to a different unit or interpret the value incorrectly.  Another common issue is using a selector that's too broad which unintentionally styles elements you did not intend to style, leading to unexpected visual results. For example, using `div` when you meant `div.specificClass`.  Finally, issues with specificity can occur; more specific selectors override less specific ones, potentially leading to styles not applying as expected.
